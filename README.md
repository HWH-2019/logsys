# logsys
This is a comprehensive exercise project for linux kernel modification, including adding system calls, modifying the xfs file system, adding block device drivers, timer usage and page fault interrupt statistics. We have combined these five parts into a log management system, of course the effect is very simple, but I believe it is enough for an exercise. In addition to providing the source code of the final effect, a detailed tutorial on the operation of different modules is also specially prepared. Of course, in order to integrate it, we finally made some adjustments, but starting from the simplest, I believe you can understand the linux kernel better.
